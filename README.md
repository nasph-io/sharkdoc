Sharkdoc is a component part of the **Nasph Platform**, which is 100% Opensouce, delived under Apache Software License 2.0. We combined some interesting concepts in this tool, such as the following:

-  ***CMS platform built with Node.js*** - We are using as the backend for the APIs a very popular opensource project called [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). We added some models and some capabilities in order to enable a kind of API Governance center.

-  ***Static Site Generator*** - We are using the very popular opensource project sponsoded by *facebook*: [Docussaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Using that approach, companies are able to deliver a very compeling and complete API Dev & Docs Portal. In our customized Docussaurus distro, we are delivering some additional components, such as Swagger/OAS rendering.

-  ***Code Generation approach*** - Pretty cool approach for accelerate any kind of development.

  

Sharkdoc was built with node.js, just for simplicity and the idea to get contributions from the wide range community aroung such platform.

  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Using the tool

  

We expect the tool to be as easy as:

  

sharkdoc --apiname SomeAPI --out SomeAPI.md

  

This code will do the following:

  

- Will connected to Strapi API to get the API information using the API Name as the search key, and then we will get the whole information we need.

- The file SomeAPI.md will be created in the ./doc folder in Docussaurus project tree.
